			<li>Title: A Math History Pop Quiz</li>
			<li>Abstract: Is your view of mathematics an endless cycle of Lemma → Proof → Theorem → Repeat? Does the world of math ever feel like a story with no characters? Prepare to change your mind! In this talk, we will reveal some of the dramatic and chaotic stories behind math - focusing more on the mathematicians and less on the math itself - through a fun quiz. We will journey through documented history, famous folklore, and some stories that are simply too good to be true.

			<li>Title: The Strong Law of Small Numbers</li>
			<li>Abstract: Did you know that except for 6, all numbers are prime powers? What about that at least half of all numbers are Fibonacci numbers? I checked for all numbers less than 10 and it's true, and if it holds for so many cases it must be true! In this talk we will explore many other wonderful "theorems" and the numbers that disproved them.</li>

			<li>Title: Don't choose if you don't have to</li>
			<li>Abstract: Many familiar theorems in topology, algebra and analysis are traditionally proved using the axiom of choice. However, surprisingly often, these theorems admit a stronger version: alternative proofs exist with no appeal to choice. In this talk, I will sketch various common, unnecessarily choicey proofs, and present a choice-free alternative.</li>

			<li>Title: How Far Can You See In An Orchard, or, What Is It Like To Live In Various Topological Spaces?</li>
			<li>Abstract:
Imagine...an orchard.  Trees everywhere, except for the spot you're standing.  Specifically, you're standing at the origin, and there's a tree at every integer lattice point.  How far can you see, if you choose the correct direction?  We'll also consider what it feels like to live in various manifolds (with or without boundary), and how validly deck transforming the universal cover determines what you can see.</li>
