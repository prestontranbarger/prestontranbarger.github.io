			<li>Title: A Math History Pop Quiz</li>
			<li>Abstract: Is your view of mathematics an endless cycle of Lemma → Proof → Theorem → Repeat? Does the world of math ever feel like a story with no characters? Prepare to change your mind! In this talk, we will reveal some of the dramatic and chaotic stories behind math - focusing more on the mathematicians and less on the math itself - through a fun quiz. We will journey through documented history, famous folklore, and some stories that are simply too good to be true.
