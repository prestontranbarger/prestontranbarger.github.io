I completed my complex analysis and algebra qualifying exams in August 2024,<br>
my real analysis exam in January 2025,<br>
and my oral exam in December 2025.<br>
<br>
These are some of the notes/materials I created/used to pass my exams, and hopefully they will help future students pass theirs.<br>
I am certainly not infallable, and there are probably mistakes in some of my solutions (please <a href="https://prestontranbarger.github.io/contact">let me know</a> if you find any so that I can update them).<br>
<br>
The notes on complex analysis and my oral exam are the most extensive as I spent the most time preparing for these.<br>
I got lucky passing algebra without any prep, and only had a week in the winter to prepare for real analysis; as such, the notes for these are non-existant/short.<br>
